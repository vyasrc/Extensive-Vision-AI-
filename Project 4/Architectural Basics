1. Image normalization(Pixel Normalization):-
Pixels are normalized between 0 and 1 before the model is defined.
2. How many layers:-
Determine the number of convolution layers required , so that the global receptive field is same as the sixze of the object, which in some cases will be the whole image or not.
3. Receptive Field :-  
The global receptive field should be equal to the object size , which sometimes may be the whole image or not.
4. Maxpooling:- 
Maxpooling is the used when we need to reduce the spatial size of the input image inorder to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network. 
5. Position of Maxpooling:-
This layer is usually used after the convloution layer from which features/edges/gradients/parts of objects are extracted.
6. 3x3 Convolutions :- 
3x3 convolutions is standardised across GPUs , so it is used in all convolutional layers.
7. 1x1 Convolutions :-
1x1 Convolutions are used to reduce the number of channels, to reduce the number of parameters in the network and it is usually used after each Maxpooling layer.
8. Concept of Transition Layers:- 
Transition Layers are the layers are used to reduce the number of channels, by using 1x1 convolutions.
9. Position of Transition Layer:- 
Usually the transition layer is positioned after a Maxpooling layer in a network or it can be placed anywhere according to the requirement in the network.
10. The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction:
The output prediction will always be 2-3 convolutions away from the last maxpooling layer.
11. Softmax :- 
Softmax is used in classification problems, where it outputs the probablity range.It is not used in face recognition, or medical purposes , where it is not suitable.
12. When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative (which we have not yet covered):- 
When the desired receptive field , that covers the size of image, is obtained , convolutions can be stopped and some alternative methods can be used like global average pooling and also using a lagre kernel size.
13. Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels? :-
14. How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early :-
